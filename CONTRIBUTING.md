# Contributing to Simple-php-programs

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This file explains how to get started and the contribution workflow.

How to get started
1. Fork the repository and create a branch:
   - git checkout -b feat/add-example
2. Make small, focused changes per branch.
3. Run any relevant tests or syntax checks (see below).
4. Open a pull request describing your changes.

Coding & style
- Keep examples simple and well-documented.
- Prefer readable code over clever one-liners.
- Add a short comment at the top of each example describing what it demonstrates.

Running checks (basic)
- Syntax check for all PHP files:
  - php -l path/to/file.php
- If the repo uses Composer/PHUnit:
  - composer install
  - vendor/bin/phpunit

Pull request checklist
- [ ] My change is small and focused
- [ ] I added or updated documentation for the example
- [ ] I ran php -l on changed files
- [ ] Tests (if any) pass

Good first contributions
- Look for issues labeled `good first issue`.
- We welcome small examples, documentation improvements, and simple bug fixes.

Communication
- Be respectful and constructive.
- Report major changes via an issue first if they affect many examples.

Maintainers will respond to PRs as soon as possible. Thank you for helping improve Simple-php-programs!
